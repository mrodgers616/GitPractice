# Is Java Still Relevant
(https://sdtimes.com/java/is-java-still-relevant/)

### Summary

Java has been around for a long time and has seen many updates to retain relevancy. It is still the most popular programming language for developers
but that will not last forever. Languages like python are rapidly growing in popularity. Java was able to become so popular
because it was in the right place at the right time, similar to python now with the growing interest in AI and machine learning.
Despite the competition with other languages rising in popularity it is believed that Java will still continue to grow over the next
years if not longer.

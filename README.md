# Is Java Still Relevant
(https://sdtimes.com/java/is-java-still-relevant/)

### Summary

Java has been around for a long time and has seen many updates to retain relevancy. It is still the most popular programming language for developers
but that will not last forever. Languages like python are rapidly growing in popularity. Java was able to become so popular
because it was in the right place at the right time, similar to python now with the growing interest in AI and machine learning.
Despite the competition with other languages rising in popularity it is believed that Java will still continue to grow over the next
years if not longer.

### Commentary

It seems to me that Java relies on its past enterprise momentum more than anything it has to offer as a programming language. So while it may stay relevant due to the sheer number of companies relying on it right now, it's being outpaced by other languages and no longer used as much for cutting-edge applications. Additionally, while its biggest feature is cross-platform compatibility, we live in a time of webapps, Electron, and other solutions for cross-platform work that can be preferable.
